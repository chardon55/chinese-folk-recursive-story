def tell_a_story
    puts 'In the past, there was a mountain.'
    puts 'In the mountain lay a temple.'
    puts 'At the temple lived two monks.'
    puts 'An elder monk, and a child monk.'
    puts 'The elder monk was telling a story to the child one.'
    puts 'What he was telling is...'
    tell_a_story
end
```
